## My process

### Built with

- Responsive design 
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
I learned how powerful flexbox and grid are in CSS, especially when they are combined together. By combining them together I was able to create this beautiful layout. This project taught me how to combine Flexbox and Grid in order to create a two or more-dimensional layout. I believe that if I keep learning and improving my CSS skills, I will be able to use those two concepts to their fullest potential.
